## Part 1: Fundamental Principles

### Electromagnetic Principles

**Fleming's Left-Hand Rule (Motor Action)**
When a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a mechanical force. The direction is given by Fleming's left-hand rule:
- **Thumb**: Direction of force (motion)
- **First finger**: Direction of magnetic field (North to South)
- **Middle finger**: Direction of current

**Force on a Conductor**
```
F = BIL sin θ
```
Where:
- F = Force (Newtons)
- B = Magnetic flux density (Tesla)
- I = Current (Amperes)
- L = Length of conductor (meters)
- θ = Angle between B and I

### Back EMF (Counter EMF)

When a DC motor rotates, the conductors cut through magnetic field lines, inducing a back EMF that opposes the applied voltage.

**Back EMF Equation**:
```
Eb = (PΦNZ)/(60A)
```
Where:
- Eb = Back EMF (Volts)
- P = Number of poles
- Φ = Flux per pole (Weber)
- N = Speed (RPM)
- Z = Total number of conductors
- A = Number of parallel paths

**Simplified Form**:
```
Eb = kΦN
```
Where k = (PZ)/(60A) = constant for a given machine

## Part 4: Operating Equations

### Fundamental Equations

**Voltage Equation (Armature Circuit)**:
```
V = Eb + IaRa
```
Where:
- V = Applied voltage (Volts)
- Eb = Back EMF (Volts)
- Ia = Armature current (Amperes)
- Ra = Armature resistance (Ohms)

**Torque Equation**:
```
T = (PΦIAZ)/(2πA) = kΦIa
```
Where:
- T = Torque (N-m)
- k = Motor constant

**Power Relations**:
```
Mechanical Power = EbIa
Electrical Power Input = VIa
Power Loss in Armature = Ia²Ra
```

**Speed Equation**:
From Eb = kΦN, we get:
```
N = (V - IaRa)/(kΦ)
```

## Part 6: Starting of DC Motors

### Need for Starters

At starting, Eb = 0, so starting current would be:
```
Istart = V/Ra
```

Since Ra is very small (0.1 to 1 Ω), starting current can be 10-20 times the rated current, which can:
