# **Lecture 1.1: Introduction to Control Systems**

---

## 🌟 **What is a Control System?**

✅ A *control system* is a set of devices managing, commanding, or regulating the behavior of another system to achieve a desired performance automatically.

✅ In simple words, it *makes a system behave the way you want it to behave* with minimal human intervention.

## 🏠 **Why Control Systems Matter?**

Consider these daily examples:
🔹 **Washing machine** — washes clothes following a cycle
🔹 **Traffic light** — controls traffic flow with preprogrammed cycles
🔹 **Electric iron** — maintains constant heat by turning off and on
🔹 **Air conditioner** — keeps room temperature stable

👉 These systems **improve safety, efficiency, consistency, and productivity**, showing the vital role of control systems engineering in society.

## ⚖️ **Open-loop vs Closed-loop Control Systems**

| **Aspect**           | **Open-loop**                  | **Closed-loop**                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Feedback**         | ❌ No feedback                  | ✅ Uses feedback                                |
| **Error correction** | ❌ Cannot self-correct          | ✅ Self-corrects based on actual performance    |
| **Example**          | Traffic light with fixed cycle | Air conditioner maintaining target temperature |
| **Complexity**       | Low                            | Higher                                         |
