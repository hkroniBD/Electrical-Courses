# Control Systems Course Design Prompt

## Course Requirements

I want to design a **Research-oriented Control Course with Python** with the following specifications:

### Course Structure
- **Format**: Self-paced modules
- **Target Audience**: Mixed skill levels (undergraduate and graduate students)
- **Scope**: Both classical and modern control theory + latest research practices
- **Completeness**: Basic to advanced topics - a complete control course with no time constraints

### Technical Requirements
- **Programming**: 
  - Standard and easy-to-use Python packages
  - MATLAB code examples alongside Python implementations
- **Applications**: Focus on electrical engineering examples, specifically:
  - Machines (motors, generators)
  - Power converters
- **Theory Integration**: Necessary theory backup with practical coding focus

### Content Format
- **Primary Format**: Markdown content only
- **Self-Sufficiency**: Lectures should be standalone and complete
- **Supplementary Resources**: Include relevant YouTube or free online videos as "further reading" support where helpful
- **Engagement**: Content should be engaging and charming to read with nice aesthetics, relevant icons, and good formatting

### Research Integration
- **Citations**: Include relevant research papers for each topic to provide research direction
- **Depth**: Don't dive deep into papers, but connect learning to research practices
- **Motivation**: Show learners they are learning effective, cutting-edge concepts

### Assessment
- Include quiz questions throughout the course
- Provide solutions for all quiz questions

### Key Deliverables
Create a comprehensive course that:
1. Covers the complete spectrum of control systems (classical to modern)
2. Integrates both Python and MATLAB coding examples throughout
3. Uses electrical engineering applications as primary examples
4. Connects theory to current research practices
5. Maintains engaging, well-formatted markdown presentation
6. Includes self-assessment opportunities

The course should bridge the gap between academic learning and practical research applications, making students industry and research-ready with proficiency in both Python and MATLAB environments.
