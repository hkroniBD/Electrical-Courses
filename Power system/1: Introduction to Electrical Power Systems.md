# Lecture 1: Introduction to Electrical Power Systems ⚡️


## Ice-Breaker: Fun Facts to Spark Curiosity 🌟
- **Tesla vs. Edison Rivalry** 😺: Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison’s “War of the Currents” in the 1880s shaped modern grids. Edison’s DC lost to Tesla’s AC, which powers Bangladesh’s 50 Hz grid today!
- **World’s First Power Plant** 🏭: Edison’s Pearl Street Station (1882, 110 V DC) served a 1-mile radius—unlike Bangladesh’s modern 230 kV grid spanning thousands of kilometers!
- **Bangladesh’s Power Leap** 🇧🇩: In 1971, only 3% of Bangladesh had electricity; by 2022, over 85% had access, thanks to efforts by BPDB and REB![](https://www.adb.org/projects/49423-005/main)[](https://www.iea.org/countries/bangladesh)
- **Lightning Power** ⚡: A lightning bolt could power a Bangladeshi village for a day, but capturing it remains a challenge for engineers!

## 1. Overview of Power Systems 🏭
Electrical power systems deliver electricity through three stages, critical to Bangladesh’s growing economy:

- **Generation** ⚙️: Power plants (e.g., gas, coal, solar) produce electricity at **11–25 kV**, with Bangladesh’s grid operating at **50 Hz**. Installed capacity: ~28.3 GW (2023).[](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/bangladesh-power-market-analysis/)
- **Transmission** 🔌: High-voltage lines (e.g., **132 kV, 230 kV**) transport power with minimal losses. Bangladesh’s grid includes ~2,314 km of 230 kV lines.[](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Power_System)
- **Distribution** 🏠: Local networks deliver power at **400 V (households), 11–33 kV (primary)** to consumers across urban and rural areas.

Frequency stability at 50 Hz ensures synchronization across Bangladesh’s grid.

## 2. Key Authorities in Bangladesh’s Power Sector 🇧🇩
Key organizations manage Bangladesh’s power industry, connecting theory to real-world operations:

- **Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB)**: Oversees generation (~75% of supply) and distribution, operating plants like Ashuganj (gas) and Barapukuria (coal).[](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Power_System)
- **Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB)**: Manages the national transmission grid (e.g., 230 kV, 132 kV lines), ensuring efficient power transfer.[](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Power_System)
- **Rural Electrification Board (REB)**: Expands electricity access in rural areas via cooperatives, connecting ~16 million households.[](https://energypedia.info/wiki/Bangladesh_Energy_Situation)
- **Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA)**: Promotes renewables (e.g., solar parks with 1,070 MW capacity), targeting 17% renewable energy by 2041.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_Bangladesh)[](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/bangladesh-power-market-analysis/)
- **Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC)**: Regulates tariffs, licenses, and consumer protection, ensuring fair pricing and competition.[](https://energypedia.info/wiki/Bangladesh_Energy_Situation)

These authorities drive Bangladesh’s goal of universal electrification and sustainable energy.

## 3. Key Components of Power Systems 🛠️
Power systems rely on components with technical roles:

- **Generators** 🔄: Synchronous generators (e.g., salient-pole for hydro, cylindrical for gas) produce electricity at 11–25 kV, 50 Hz.
- **Transformers** 🔃: Adjust voltages using turns ratios (N1/N2 = V1/V2), e.g., stepping up from 11 kV to 230 kV for transmission.
- **Transmission Lines** 🌐: Use ACSR (Aluminum Conductor Steel Reinforced) conductors for 132–230 kV lines, spanning ~7,800 km in Bangladesh.[](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Power_System)
- **Distribution Networks** 🕸️: Deliver power at 400 V (households) or 11–33 kV (industry) via radial or ring systems.

## 4. Importance in Modern Society 🌍
Power systems are vital for Bangladesh:

- **Economic Growth** 💡: Support industries (e.g., textiles) with reliable 50 Hz, 230 kV power.
- **Daily Life** 🏡: Enable appliances at 400 V (Bangladesh’s household standard).
- **Sustainability** 🌱: Facilitate renewable integration (e.g., solar, wind) via SREDA.
- **Reliability** 🛡️: Maintain stable 50 Hz frequency despite challenges like load shedding.[](https://cpd.org.bd/power-and-energy-crisis-in-bangladesh/)

## 5. Historical Evolution of Power Systems 📜
Power systems evolved globally and in Bangladesh:

- **Late 19th Century** 🕰️: DC systems (110 V) were limited by high losses, as in Edison’s early plants.
- **Early 20th Century** 💡: AC systems (50 Hz in Bangladesh) enabled high-voltage transmission (132 kV) via transformers.
- **Mid-20th Century** 🏭: Bangladesh’s grid began with BPDB in 1972, expanding to 230 kV lines.[](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Power_System)
- **21st Century** 🌞: Modern grids integrate renewables (e.g., 28 MW solar in Teknaf) and HVDC (e.g., ±500 kV imports from India).[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_Bangladesh)
