- **🇧🇩 Bangladesh Context**: 
  - Natural gas-fired plants (dominant source - ~75% of capacity)
  - Coal-fired plants (Payra, Matarbari under construction)
  - Oil-fired plants (backup and peaking)
  - Renewable sources (solar, wind - growing sector)
  - Hydroelectric (Kaptai - 230 MW)

#### 1.2 🔌 Transmission
- **Purpose**: Transport bulk electrical power from generation sites to load centers
- **🇧🇩 Bangladesh Context**:
  - Operated by Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB)
  - Voltage levels: 400 kV, 230 kV, 132 kV
  - National Grid covers most of the country
  - Cross-border connections with India (1160 MW import capacity)

#### 1.3 🏠 Distribution
- **Purpose**: Deliver electricity to end consumers
- **🇧🇩 Bangladesh Context**:
  - Multiple Distribution Companies (DISCOs)
  - Palli Bidyut Samities (PBS) for rural areas
  - Dhaka Electric Supply Company (DESCO)
  - Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC)
