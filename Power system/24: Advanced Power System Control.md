## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Ice-Breaker: ‚ÄúWho Controls the Grid?‚Äù üß†‚ö°

Imagine a sudden drop in solar generation due to cloud cover over northern Bangladesh. The grid frequency dips. Within seconds, an **automated control system** dispatches spinning reserves from gas generators and restores balance ‚Äî no manual action needed.
This is **Advanced Power System Control** in action ‚Äî the brain behind real-time decisions in smart grids.

## üéØ Lecture Objectives

After completing this lecture, students will be able to:

* Understand **optimal and predictive control** strategies in power systems
* Explain the role of **wide-area control systems**
* Explore **control integration of renewables and microgrids**
* Analyze challenges and strategies in dynamic control environments

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Advanced Control Strategies

### üîπ Optimal Control

Optimal control aims to operate the power system **at minimum cost or maximum efficiency**, subject to system constraints.

#### Key Features:

* Objective: Minimize cost or loss, or maximize reliability
* Constraints: Voltage limits, power balance, generator limits
* Techniques: Lagrangian methods, Pontryagin‚Äôs principle, dynamic programming

### üîπ Model Predictive Control (MPC)

MPC uses a **model of the system to predict future states** and optimize control actions over a prediction horizon.

| Aspect           | Model Predictive Control (MPC)            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Forecasting      | Predicts future states of system          |
| Decision Horizon | Finite (e.g., next 5‚Äì15 mins)             |
| Updates          | Re-optimizes at every time step           |
| Applications     | Voltage control, wind & solar integration |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **In Bangladesh context:** MPC is gaining importance in **solar-battery hybrid microgrids**, such as projects implemented in **Sundarbans solar islands**.

## üåê 2. Wide-Area Control Systems (WACS)

Traditional control systems operate **locally**, but wide-area control involves **global visibility of the grid** using communication networks.

### üß† Key Concepts:

* Utilizes PMUs (Phasor Measurement Units)
* Centralized or distributed control
* Enables **real-time dynamic stability control**

### üìä WACS vs. Traditional SCADA

| Feature                | SCADA Control           | Wide-Area Control       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Data Refresh Rate      | 2‚Äì10 seconds            | 30‚Äì60 times/second      |
| Communication          | Slow (legacy protocols) | Fast (IP/MPLS)          |
| Dynamic Event Response | Delayed                 | Near-instant            |
| Coverage               | Local/Regional          | National/Interconnected |

> ‚úÖ **Bangladesh Example:** The **Bangladesh Power Grid Company (PGCB)** has initiated **PMU deployment** in key substations under the Power Grid Expansion Project for better visibility and wide-area control.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è 3. Control Concepts for Renewable Integration and Microgrids

Integration of variable renewable energy (VRE) and microgrids presents new challenges in control and coordination.

### üîß Challenges:

* Variability and intermittency of renewables
* Voltage fluctuations and reverse power flow
* Grid synchronization in islanded operation

### üîå Grid-Connected vs Islanded Control in Microgrids

| Feature                  | Grid-Connected Mode              | Islanded Mode                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Control Objective        | Voltage regulation, power export | Voltage/frequency stability    |
| Frequency Source         | Main grid                        | Local inverter or generator    |
| Energy Management        | Based on price/load forecast     | Based on storage & load demand |
| Resynchronization Needed | No                               | Yes (before reconnecting)      |

> üèùÔ∏è **Bangladesh Projects:** The **Solar Mini-Grids in Hatiya, Sandwip**, and **Monpura islands** operate in islanded mode at night using battery-DG hybrids, switching to grid mode when available.
