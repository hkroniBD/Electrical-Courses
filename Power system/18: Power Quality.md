## ❄️ Ice-Breaker: Why Do LED Bulbs Flicker in Rural Areas of Bangladesh? 💡🇧🇩

* Have you noticed **LED or CFL lights flickering** or fans slowing down during evening peak hours in villages?
* Industries in Narayanganj or Gazipur often experience **frequent motor trips** or inverter faults.

These are real examples of **power quality issues** faced in Bangladesh due to **unbalanced rural loads, overloaded feeders, and lack of proper mitigation infrastructure**.

## 📘 Overview of Power Quality

**Power Quality (PQ)** in Bangladesh is a growing concern due to rising **industrialization**, increased use of **nonlinear loads**, and integration of **solar PV** in remote areas.

### 🔎 Why Power Quality Matters (Especially in Bangladesh)

* Sensitive imported machines in **garment factories** malfunction due to poor PQ.
* Rural electrification suffers from **voltage instability** and harmonics from cheap inverters.
* **Smart grid plans** under PGCB and DPDC require better PQ enforcement.

## ⚠️ Common Power Quality Problems in Bangladesh

| Issue             | Description                                            | Real Example in BD                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Voltage Sag**   | Temporary voltage drop (10–90% of nominal for 0.5–1s)  | Observed during motor start in Rajshahi rice mills |
| **Voltage Swell** | Sudden voltage rise above 110% of nominal              | Reported in Bogura due to switching surges         |
| **Harmonics**     | Caused by low-cost solar inverters and cheap UPS units | Rampura and Mirpur households                      |
| **Flicker**       | Rapid voltage fluctuations in rural feeders            | Seen in off-grid areas using solar + diesel        |
| **Transients**    | Lightning-induced spikes common during monsoons        | Especially in coastal districts like Barisal       |
| **Interruptions** | Unscheduled outages and reconnections                  | Common in Chattogram hill tract zones              |

## 🧪 Causes of Power Quality Disturbances

1. **Non-linear loads**: Cheap Chinese inverters, UPS, CFL ballasts
2. **Switching operations**: Sudden energization in REB networks
3. **Grid faults**: Poor insulation, tree faults in rural lines
4. **Unbalanced loads**: Rural feeders with random household connections
5. **Industrial effects**: Garments/knit factories with large induction motors

## 🔬 Theoretical Parameters & Standards

### IEEE & IEC Guidelines (Adopted in Bangladesh via PGCB & BERC)

| Parameter       | IEEE 519 Limit | Common Status in BD                |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| THD (Voltage)   | < 5%           | Often >8% in industrial areas      |
| Voltage Flicker | < 1%           | Frequently exceeded in REB feeders |
| Voltage Sag     | < 10% drop     | Occurs during peak load times      |

> **Note:** Bangladesh does not yet have a fully enforced **national PQ code**, but **BERC and PGCB** are preparing to align with **IEEE 519** for future grid upgrades.

## 🪄 Power Quality Mitigation Techniques (Applicable to Bangladesh)

### 🎛️ Passive Filters

* Installed in **textile factories in Gazipur** to control 5th & 7th harmonics
* Used by BPDB in some substations for voltage stability

### ⚙️ Active Power Filters

* Being introduced in new **solar mini-grids** under IDCOL projects

### ⚡ DVR (Dynamic Voltage Restorer)

* Pilot projects ongoing in **DPDC industrial zones**

### 🔋 UPS + AVR Systems

* Widely used in **private universities and hospitals**

### 🔄 Static VAR Compensators

* Not yet common in Bangladesh, but **PGCB's HV substation upgrades** may include them

## 📊 Monitoring & Analysis Tools in Bangladesh

* **DPDC & PGCB** now use **PQ analyzers from Siemens and Fluke**
* **REB** has limited instrumentation in rural areas
* **Smart meters** being rolled out under the **Smart Grid Roadmap**
