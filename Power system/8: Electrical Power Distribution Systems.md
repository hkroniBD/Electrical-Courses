## Introduction to Power Distribution Systems

Electrical power distribution systems transfer electricity from transmission substations to consumers, including residential, commercial, and industrial users. Operating at medium (11 kV, 33 kV) and low voltages (0.4 kV), they ensure efficient power delivery with minimal losses. In Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (BREB) and Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC) manage distribution networks, delivering power to over 20 million households.

## Components of Distribution Systems

* **Feeders:** Primary distribution lines (11 kV or 33 kV) carrying power from substations to load centers.
* **Distribution Transformers:** Step down voltage (e.g., 11/0.4 kV) for consumer use, typically 25‚Äì500 kVA.
* **Service Mains:** Connect transformers to consumer premises, usually at 400/230 V.
* **Protective Devices:** Fuses, circuit breakers, and reclosers protect against faults like short circuits.
* **Earthing Systems:** Ensure safety by grounding neutral and equipment, common in BREB‚Äôs 11 kV networks.
* **Metering Systems:** Measure consumer usage for billing, e.g., smart meters in Dhaka.

## Voltage Levels in Bangladesh

* **Primary Distribution:** 11 kV or 33 kV for feeders connecting substations to load centers.
* **Secondary Distribution:** 400/230 V for residential and commercial users.
* **Sub-transmission:** 33 kV for intermediate power transfer in semi-urban areas like Sylhet.

*Example:* BREB‚Äôs 11/0.4 kV transformers in Khulna serve rural households, while DPDC uses 33/11 kV for urban loads.

## Power Losses in Distribution

Losses include:

* **Technical Losses:** $I^2R$ losses in conductors, transformer losses.
* **Non-technical Losses:** Theft, metering errors.

Typical losses in Bangladesh are 10‚Äì15%, with BREB targeting less than 10% through amorphous core transformers.

**Loss Calculation:**

$$
P_{\text{loss}} = I^2 \times R
$$

*Example:*
For a 1 km 11 kV feeder conductor with 0.1 Œ©/km resistance carrying 100 A:

$$
P_{\text{loss}} = 100^2 \times 0.1 = 10,000 \times 0.1 = 1,000 \text{ W} = 1 \text{ kW}
$$

*Note:* For a three-phase system, total losses would be higher, considering all conductors.

## Maintenance Practices

* **Line Inspections:** Monthly checks for damaged insulators or sagging conductors.
* **Transformer Maintenance:** Oil testing (dielectric strength ‚â•30 kV/2.5 mm), Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA), and bushing checks.
* **Vegetation Management:** Clear tree branches near 11 kV lines to prevent faults, practiced by BREB.
* **Meter Calibration:** Ensure accurate billing, conducted annually by DPDC.

*Example:* BREB‚Äôs quarterly maintenance in Khulna reduces outages by 20%.

---

## Distribution System Design Considerations

* **Load Forecasting:** Predict demand using historical data, e.g., Dhaka‚Äôs 5% annual load growth.
* **Conductor Selection:** Use ACSR (Aluminum Conductor Steel Reinforced) for 11 kV feeders due to strength.
* **Reliability Indices:** SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index) and SAIFI (System Average Interruption Frequency Index) guide improvements. BREB targets SAIDI < 50 hours/year.
* **Smart Grids:** DPDC‚Äôs smart meters in Dhaka enable real-time monitoring and loss reduction.

* **Rural Electrification:** BREB‚Äôs 11/0.4 kV networks power 80% of rural households.
* **Urban Distribution:** DPDC‚Äôs 33/11 kV ring systems ensure reliable power in Dhaka.
* **Industrial Supply:** Meshed 33 kV systems in Chittagong support textile factories.
* **Renewable Integration:** Solar farms in Feni feed 11 kV grids via step-up transformers.
* **Loss Reduction:** Capacitor banks in Sylhet improve power factor, saving 5‚Äì10 MW annually.
