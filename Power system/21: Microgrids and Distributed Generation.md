## üåü Ice-Breaker: From National Grid to Local Energy Islands

üîå Bangladesh's national power grid has faced severe strain during peak demand periods.
üå¥ Imagine a coastal village during a cyclone where the national grid fails ‚Äî yet a small **microgrid** keeps a hospital and homes powered by solar panels and batteries.
This is **the promise of distributed generation and microgrids** ‚Äî **resilience and sustainability** at the local level.

## üîç What is a Microgrid?

A **microgrid** is a **localized energy system** that can operate independently or in conjunction with the main grid.

### üîß Key Features:

* Can **disconnect and reconnect** from the main grid (islanded mode)
* Integrates **renewable sources**, **storage systems**, and **control devices**
* Improves **resilience**, **efficiency**, and **power quality**

## üè≠ What is Distributed Generation (DG)?

**Distributed Generation (DG)** refers to **small-scale electricity generation** technologies located close to the load.
