## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Ice-Breaker: Power Across Oceans üåä‚ö°

The **North Sea Link** connects Norway and the UK through a 720 km HVDC subsea cable, transmitting up to **1.4 GW** of power. Why HVDC and not AC? Let‚Äôs dive into this question.

Bangladesh is currently studying HVDC options to improve **cross-border power exchange** with India ‚Äî making HVDC more relevant to our future grid.

## üîç Introduction to HVDC

**High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)** systems transmit electricity using direct current over long distances. 

### ‚úÖ Advantages Over AC:

- Lower transmission losses over long distances
- No reactive power issues
- Better control over power flow
- Enables asynchronous grid interconnections

## üß± Basic Components of HVDC System

| Component            | Function                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Converter Station   | Converts AC to DC and vice versa         |
| Transmission Line   | Carries high-voltage DC power            |
| Filter Banks        | Removes harmonics                        |
| Smoothing Reactors  | Minimizes current ripple                 |
| Ground Electrode    | Provides return path for current         |

## üõ†Ô∏è Converter Technologies

### 1. **Line Commutated Converters (LCC)**

- Also called **Current Source Converter (CSC)**
- Uses **thyristors**
- Requires strong AC grid for commutation
- Generates reactive power
- **Preferred for bulk transmission** (e.g., 1000 MW+)

### 2. **Voltage Source Converters (VSC)**

- Uses **IGBTs**
- Can operate in weak or passive grids
- Provides **independent control of active/reactive power**
- Smaller footprint, suitable for offshore wind, microgrids

|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Switching Device        | Thyristors               | IGBTs                        |
| Grid Requirement        | Strong grid needed       | Can work with weak grid      |
| Reactive Power          | Consumes reactive power  | Provides reactive support    |
| Control Flexibility     | Limited                  | High                         |
| Applications            | Bulk transmission        | Urban/subsea/microgrid       |

## üß™ Theoretical Applications of HVDC

1. **Long-Distance Transmission**
   - Reduces loss significantly (over 600 km)

2. **Interconnecting Asynchronous Grids**
   - Useful in cross-border links (e.g., India-Bangladesh)

3. **Offshore Wind Power Integration**
   - Efficiently connects remote wind farms to the grid

4. **Stabilizing Power Systems**
   - Acts as a controllable link for power flow and voltage support
