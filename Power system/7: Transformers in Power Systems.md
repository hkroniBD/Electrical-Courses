## Key Points  
- Transformers use electromagnetic induction to step up or down voltage, achieving high efficiency (98‚Äì99.5%).  
- Types include power, distribution, and autotransformers, each serving specific roles in Bangladesh‚Äôs grid.  
- Nameplates list critical specs like kVA, voltage ratio, and vector group for operation and maintenance.  
- Regular maintenance, such as oil testing and inspections, prevents faults like overheating or insulation failure.  
- Safety measures, including grounding and protective devices, ensure safe operation.  
- Common connections like Delta-Star (Dyn11) are widely used for their neutral and fault isolation benefits.  

## Transformer Working Principles and Construction  
Transformers transfer electrical energy between circuits using **electromagnetic induction**. An AC voltage applied to the primary winding creates a magnetic flux in the core, inducing a voltage in the secondary winding proportional to the turns ratio: $V_s / V_p = N_s / N_p$. Key components include a laminated silicon steel **core**, copper/aluminum **windings**, and **insulation** (oil or dry-type). Accessories like **bushings**, **conservator tanks**, and **Buchholz relays** ensure reliable operation. In Bangladesh, 230/132 kV transformers at Ashuganj step down voltage for distribution.

## Types of Transformers  
- **Power Transformers**: Handle high voltages (e.g., 400/230 kV) for transmission, with ratings like 100‚Äì200 MVA. Used by PGCB at Dhaka East.  
- **Distribution Transformers**: Step down to 11/0.4 kV for end-users, with sizes like 25‚Äì500 kVA. BREB uses these in rural Dinajpur.  
- **Autotransformers**: Efficient for small voltage changes (e.g., 230/132 kV), used at Comilla for cost-effective power transfer.

## Transformer Losses and Efficiency  
Losses include **core losses** (hysteresis and eddy currents) and **copper losses** (I¬≤R). Efficiency, calculated as $\eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{out} + P_{losses}} \times 100\%$, typically exceeds 98%. For example, a 50 MVA transformer with 0.5 MW losses achieves 99.01% efficiency. PGCB‚Äôs transformers at Sirajganj minimize losses, saving energy costs.

## Voltage Regulation and Tap Changing  
**Voltage regulation** measures the voltage drop from no-load to full-load, ideally within 0.95‚Äì1.05 pu. **Tap changers** adjust the turns ratio: **off-load** for manual adjustments and **on-load tap changers (OLTC)** for real-time control. OLTCs at Tongi stabilize Dhaka‚Äôs grid during peak loads.

## Transformer Nameplate Technical Terms  
Transformer nameplates provide critical specifications for operation and maintenance. Common terms include:  

| Term | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **kVA/MVA Rating** | Apparent power capacity | 100 MVA |
| **Voltage Ratio** | Primary/secondary voltages | 230/11 kV |
| **Impedance (%Z)** | Voltage drop due to resistance/reactance | 6% |
| **Vector Group** | Winding connection and phase shift | Dyn11 (Delta-Star, 30¬∞ lead) |

In Bangladesh, Energypac‚Äôs 50‚Äì250 kVA transformers power rural areas, while ABB‚Äôs 200 MVA units support PGCB‚Äôs grid.

## Transformer Maintenance  
Regular maintenance ensures transformer reliability:  
- **Visual Inspection**: Monthly checks for oil leaks, rust, or bushing damage.  
- **Oil Testing**: Test dielectric strength (‚â•30 kV/2.5 mm) and perform **Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA)** to detect faults ([Electrical4U Maintenance](https://www.electrical4u.com/maintenance-of-transformer/)).  
- **Cooling System**: Clean radiators and verify fan operation for ONAF transformers.  
- **Buchholz Relay**: Inspect for gas accumulation indicating internal faults.  
- **Insulation Testing**: Use a megger to check insulation resistance.  
- **Tap Changer**: Annually inspect OLTC contacts and oil.  
- **Breather**: Replace silica gel to prevent moisture ingress.  
- **Annual Checks**: Comprehensive tests including DGA and oil quality.  

In Bangladesh, BREB conducts quarterly inspections on 11 kV transformers in Khulna, ensuring minimal outages.

## Common Faults  
Transformers face several faults:  
- **Overheating**: From overloading or cooling failure, risking insulation damage.  
- **Insulation Deterioration**: Due to thermal/electrical stress, causing arcing ([ELSCO Failures](https://elscotransformers.com/blog/guide-to-transformer-failure/)).  
- **Oil Leakage**: From gaskets or tank damage, reducing insulation.  
- **Winding Faults**: Short or open circuits from stress or damage.  
- **Core Faults**: Lamination shorts increasing losses.  
- **Tap Changer Failures**: Worn OLTC contacts affecting regulation.  
- **Gas Formation**: Arcing produces gases (e.g., H‚ÇÇ, C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÇ), detected by DGA.  
- **Bushing Flashover**: From contamination or aging.  

PGCB monitors faults via DGA at Sirajganj to prevent failures.

## Safety Measures  
Safety is critical for transformer operation:  
- **Grounding**: Ensure tank and neutral grounding to prevent shocks.  
- **Protective Devices**: Use **Buchholz relays**, **pressure relief valves**, and **fuses** for fault detection ([EEP Faults](https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/5-transformer-fault-conditions)).  
- **Fire Prevention**: Employ fire-resistant oil or dry-type transformers in urban Dhaka.  
- **Enclosures**: Pad-mounted transformers with locked enclosures prevent access.  
- **PPE**: Workers use insulated gloves and arc flash protection.  
- **Warning Signs**: High-voltage warnings at substations.  

PGCB equips 230 kV transformers with fire suppression systems for safety.

## Transformer Connections  
Common configurations include:  
- **Delta-Delta (Œî-Œî)**: No phase shift, fault-tolerant, used in 33/11 kV industrial substations in Gazipur ([Electrical Easy](https://www.electricaleasy.com/2014/05/three-phase-transformer-connections.html)).  
- **Delta-Star (Œî-Y, e.g., Dyn11)**: Provides neutral, 30¬∞ phase shift, used in 230/11 kV PGCB transformers for distribution.  
- **Star-Delta (Y-Œî)**: Reduces harmonics, used for industrial loads in Chittagong.  
- **Star-Star (Y-Y)**: Neutral on both sides, less common due to harmonic issues.  
- **Open Delta (V-V)**: Emergency backup at 58% capacity, used in BREB‚Äôs 11 kV feeders.  

Delta-Star (Dyn11) dominates in Bangladesh for its neutral and fault isolation benefits ([Daelim Connections](https://www.daelimtransformer.com/transformer-connection.html)).
