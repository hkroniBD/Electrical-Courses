## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Ice-Breaker: From Monopoly to Market üè¶‚ö°

Imagine being forced to buy electricity from **only one provider**, no matter the cost or quality. That was the reality before power systems were deregulated.

üîç **Deregulation introduced competition**‚Äîlike choosing between mobile SIM providers, consumers and businesses could now select electricity providers.

üß≠ Countries like the USA, UK, India, and even Bangladesh are moving towards **open access and market participation** for more efficient energy usage.

## ‚ö° What is Power System Deregulation?

Deregulation in power systems refers to **unbundling** the vertically integrated monopoly into separate, independently functioning entities for:

- **Generation**
- **Transmission**
- **Distribution**
- **Retail**

It introduces **competition**, **open access**, and **market-based pricing**.

## üß± Traditional vs Deregulated Power System

| Feature                    | Traditional System            | Deregulated System             |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Ownership                 | Single utility (monopoly)     | Multiple private/public players |
| Pricing Mechanism         | Regulated tariff              | Market-driven prices            |
| Access                    | Closed                        | Open Access                     |
| Competition               | None                          | High                            |
| Efficiency                | Moderate                      | Improved                        |

## üèóÔ∏è Structure of Deregulated Power Market

### Key Players:

- **GENCOs**: Generation Companies
- **TRANSCOs**: Transmission Companies
- **DISCOs**: Distribution Companies
- **ISOs/RTOs**: Independent System Operators/Regional Transmission Organizations
- **Retailers** and **Consumers**

### Market Segments:

- **Day-Ahead Market**
- **Real-Time Market**
- **Ancillary Services Market**
- **Capacity Market**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Roles and Functions of ISOs

ISOs are **independent entities** that:

- Ensure **fair access** to the transmission grid
- Manage **market clearing**
- Conduct **real-time dispatch**
- Perform **contingency analysis**

üîÑ ISOs do not own assets; they **facilitate operations** and **monitor market power abuse**.

---

## üìà Theoretical Impact of Deregulation

### Advantages:

- Competitive prices
- Technological innovation
- Better customer service
- Efficient energy allocation

### Challenges:

- Price volatility
- Transmission congestion
- Market power abuse
- Complex system operation

## üåê Global Examples of Deregulated Systems

| Country        | Entity/Market Model                  | Notable Features                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| USA            | PJM, NYISO, ERCOT                    | Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP), Real-time     |
| UK             | National Grid + ELEXON               | Pool-based trading, bilateral contracts          |
| India          | POSOCO, IEX, PXIL                    | Two power exchanges, real-time markets           |
| Bangladesh     | DPDC (in part), BERC                 | Partial unbundling, IPP participation rising     |

## üìö Bangladesh Context: Partial Deregulation Progress

Bangladesh has begun **partial unbundling** of power utilities. Key milestones:

- **Independent Power Producers (IPPs)** now contribute ~50% of generation.
- BERC (Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission) acts as **pricing regulator**.
- Move toward **corporatization of DISCOs** (e.g., DPDC, DESCO).

üöß However, **open access** and **retail competition** are still under development.

## üß† Concept Check: Ancillary Services in Deregulated Market

Ancillary services ensure **reliable operation** of power systems. These include:

- Frequency regulation
- Spinning reserve
- Voltage support
- Black start capability

In deregulated markets, **generators are compensated** for providing such services.

## ‚úÖ Solutions to Viva Questions

1. **d) Load Shedding**  
   *Explanation:* Load shedding is a consequence, not a structural function in deregulation.

2. **b) Monitor and manage power markets**  
   *Explanation:* ISOs ensure market fairness and grid stability.

3. **b) Price volatility**  
   *Explanation:* Due to demand-supply mismatch and bidding strategies.

4. **c) BERC**  
   *Explanation:* BERC governs electricity tariffs and licensing in Bangladesh.

5. **a) Consumers can choose their supplier**
