## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Ice-Breaker: What if Hackers Controlled the Grid?

In December 2015, Ukraine experienced a major blackout affecting over 230,000 people. The culprit? A **cyberattack** targeting their power grid‚Äôs SCADA system. This real-life incident reveals that **power systems are now cyber-physical targets** ‚Äî not just physical infrastructure.
üîê As smart grids evolve, **cybersecurity is no longer optional** ‚Äî it is vital to national security.

## üìå 1. Why Cybersecurity Matters in Power Systems

Modern power systems rely on:

* **SCADA systems** (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
* **Smart meters and IoT devices**
* **Wide-area monitoring and control**
* **Cloud-based EMS and forecasting tools**

These components are **vulnerable to cyber threats** because they are connected to communication networks.

## üáßüá© 4. Bangladesh Context ‚Äì Cybersecurity Challenges

### üîç Real-Life Concern:

Bangladesh‚Äôs power grid is gradually digitizing through **smart grid pilot projects** (e.g., DPDC‚Äôs smart meter rollouts, SCADA upgrades). But:

* Many control centers **lack dedicated cybersecurity teams**
* **Old legacy systems** are still operational
* **No unified national smart grid cybersecurity guideline** (unlike NIST in the USA)

üîê Hence, cybersecurity **must become part of the design** of future grid modernization in Bangladesh.
