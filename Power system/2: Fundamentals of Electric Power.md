# Lecture 2: Fundamentals of Electric Power ⚡

## Objective
Understand the foundational concepts of electric power, including voltage, current, power, energy, AC vs. DC systems, single-phase and three-phase systems, and power factor, with a focus on their significance in Bangladesh’s power system.

## Ice-Breaker: Fun Facts to Spark Curiosity 🌟
- **Tesla’s AC Triumph** 😺: Nikola Tesla’s AC system, powering Bangladesh’s 50 Hz grid, beat Edison’s DC in the 1880s, enabling efficient power for Dhaka’s factories!
- **Power Factor Bills** 💡: A low power factor in Bangladesh’s industries can spike electricity costs, as BERC enforces a minimum of 0.85 to save energy!
- **Three-Phase Efficiency** ⚙️: Three-phase systems drive Chittagong’s shipyards with smooth power, unlike single-phase for homes!
- **Energy at Home** 🏠: One kWh runs a Bangladeshi household fan for ~10 hours, cooling homes in humid summers!

## 1. Basic Concepts 📏
- **Voltage (V)**: Potential difference driving electric charge, in volts. Bangladesh households use 230 V (single-phase, 400 V three-phase), per BERC. ⚡
- **Current (I)**: Flow of charge, in amperes (A). A 1.15 kW appliance at 230 V draws ~5 A, sizing PGCB’s conductors. 🔌
- **Power (P)**: Rate of energy transfer, in watts (W). For DC: Power equals voltage times current, written as $$P = V \times I$$. For AC: Power equals voltage times current times power factor, written as $$P = V \times I \times \cos \phi$$. 💡
- **Energy (E)**: Total work done, in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Energy equals power times time, written as $$E = P \times t$$ (t in hours). Average Bangladeshi household uses ~300 kWh/month, per BPDB. ⏱️

## 2. AC vs. DC Systems 🔋🔄
- **DC Systems**: Constant voltage/current, used in Bangladesh’s solar panels (12–48 V, SREDA projects) and battery backups. Limited by high transmission losses.
- **AC Systems**: Alternate at 50 Hz in Bangladesh, enabling voltage transformation (e.g., 11 kV to 230 kV by PGCB). Ideal for grid efficiency.

### Comparison Table: AC vs. DC Systems
| Aspect | DC Systems 🔋 | AC Systems 🔄 |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Voltage** | Constant (12–48 V for solar) | Alternating (230 V household, 50 Hz) |
| **Frequency** | 0 Hz | 50 Hz (Bangladesh standard) |
| **Transmission** | High losses, no transformers | Low losses with transformers |
| **Applications** | Solar, batteries | Grid, motors, appliances |

## 3. Single-Phase and Three-Phase Systems 🏠🏭
- **Single-Phase**: One waveform at 230 V, 50 Hz, powers Bangladeshi homes (e.g., lights, fans), managed by BPDB and REB.
- **Three-Phase**: Three waveforms, 120° apart, deliver 400 V for industries (e.g., Gazipur’s textile mills), offering higher power capacity.

## 4. Three-Phase Systems: Details 🌟
- **Advantages**: Higher power density, smoother delivery, and efficient conductor use, vital for Bangladesh’s industrial growth.
- **Balanced Systems**: Equal magnitude and 120° phase difference ensure stability, reducing equipment wear.
- **Connections**:
  - **Star (Y) Connection**: Phases meet at a neutral point. Line voltage is square root of 3 times phase voltage, written as $$V_L = \sqrt{3} \times V_{ph}$$. Line current equals phase current, written as $$I_L = I_{ph}$$. Common in Bangladesh’s distribution (e.g., 11 kV to 400 V).
  - **Delta (Δ) Connection**: Phases form a triangle. Line voltage equals phase voltage, written as $$V_L = V_{ph}$$. Line current is square root of 3 times phase current, written as $$I_L = \sqrt{3} \times I_{ph}$$. Used in industrial motors.
- **Phase and Line Quantities**: Line quantities (across lines) differ from phase quantities (within a phase), e.g., 400 V line voltage yields ~230 V phase voltage in Star.

## 5. Power Factor 📈
- **Definition**: Ratio of real power (P, kW) to apparent power (S, kVA), written as $$\text{PF} = \cos \phi = \frac{P}{S}$$, where \(\phi\) is the phase angle between voltage and current.
- **Significance**: High PF (≥0.85, per BERC) ensures efficient power use. Low PF in inductive loads (e.g., motors) increases losses, raising costs for Bangladesh’s industries.

## 6. Bangladesh Power Sector Context 🇧🇩
- **Authorities**:
  - **Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB)**: Ensures 50 Hz stability and distributes 230 V/400 V power.
  - **Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB)**: Manages transmission at 50 Hz, 132–230 kV.
  - **Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC)**: Enforces PF ≥0.85 for industries.
  - **Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA)**: Promotes DC-based solar systems.
- **Technical Data**: 50 Hz grid, 230 V single-phase, 400 V three-phase, ~300 kWh/month household consumption.

### Technical Data: Bangladesh Power System Fundamentals

|-----------|---------|
| **Frequency** | 50 Hz ± 0.5 Hz (BERC standard) |
| **Household Voltage** | 230 V (single-phase), 400 V (three-phase) |
| **Industrial Voltage** | 11 kV, 33 kV (primary distribution) |
| **Power Factor Standard** | ≥0.85 (BERC requirement for industries) |
| **Energy Consumption** | ~300 kWh/month (average household) |

## 7. Key Takeaways 📝
- Voltage (230 V), current, power (P = V × I × cos φ), and energy (~300 kWh/month) are core concepts.
- AC (50 Hz) dominates Bangladesh’s grid, unlike DC in solar systems.
- Three-phase systems (400 V) use Star/Delta connections for industrial efficiency.
- Power factor (≥0.85) reduces losses, regulated by BERC.
