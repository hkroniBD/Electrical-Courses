### üî¨ Introduction to Antennas

* Antennas are transducers that convert electrical signals into electromagnetic (EM) waves and vice versa.
* Critical components in communication systems, radar, broadcasting, and sensing.

---

### üîç Fundamental Antenna Parameters

* **Radiation Pattern:** Spatial distribution of radiated power.
* **Gain (G):** Measure of directionality and efficiency (dBi).
* **Directivity (D):** Focus of radiation in one direction.
* **Main Lobe:** The region of the radiation pattern containing the maximum radiation; points in the desired direction.
* **Side Lobes:** Radiation in unintended directions; should be minimized for efficient operation.
* **Bandwidth:** Frequency range over which antenna performs adequately.
* **Polarization:** Orientation of the E-field (Linear, Circular).
* **Radiation Efficiency (Œ∑):** Ratio of radiated power to input power.

### üß∞ Antenna Design Considerations

1. **Operating Frequency:** Determines physical size (Œª = c/f).
2. **Substrate Properties:** For patch antennas, permittivity affects size and bandwidth.
3. **Impedance Matching:** Typically matched to 50 Œ© to avoid reflection.
4. **Size Constraints:** Especially in portable and IoT devices.
5. **Environment:** Indoor, outdoor, embedded, wearable.
6. **Lobe Control:** Optimize design to enhance the main lobe and suppress side lobes.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Key Equations

* **Resonant Length (Dipole):** L = Œª/2

* **Effective Aperture (Ae):** Ae = (Œª^2 √ó G)/(4œÄ)

* **Friis Transmission Equation:**

  Pr = (Pt √ó Gt √ó Gr √ó Œª^2) / ((4œÄR)^2)

* **Radiation Resistance:** Represents the radiated power as an equivalent resistance.
